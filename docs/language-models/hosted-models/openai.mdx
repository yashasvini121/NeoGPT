<ParamField body="OPENAI_API_KEY" type="string" default="" required>
    Requires your OpenAI API key. To set up your API key, please refer to the [guide on setting up OpenAI API key](/guides/setup-openai-key) for detailed instructions.
</ParamField>

To use models from OpenAI, simply run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --model openai/<model-name>
```

This will default to `gpt-3.5-turbo`, which is mostly capable of generating responses to your prompts. If you want to use a different model, `gpt-4` or any other fine-tuned model, you can specify it using the `--model` flag:

```bash
python main.py --model openai/gpt-4
```


## Supported Models

All the text generation models from OpenAI are supported. You can find the full list of models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).
